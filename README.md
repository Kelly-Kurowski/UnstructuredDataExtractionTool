# Unstructured Data Extraction Tool

This software tool extracts information from unstructured documents. Users can input specific entities in the GUI (such as 'name', 'total amount', 'phone number', etc.) that they want extracted from the selected file. The tool then generates the accurate output accordingly when the user presses on the run button. 

The supported file formats include .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tif, and .img.
